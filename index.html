						<h4> League of Legends</h4>
						<p> This is an image of League of Legends, a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, or MOBA for short. The aim of the game is to work together as a team to destroy the enemies Nexus, a crystal basically. This game is very fun especially with friends. League of Legends is one of the most popular games of all time, according to Riot Games, the makers of League of Legends, There is enough active players to make up the fifth largest country in the world which is Pakistan with 215 million citizens. Every year a championship is held known as "Worlds", Last year the final was held in the east. The peak spectators at once was over 200 million people.... AT ONCE, this made Worlds 2018 one of the most viewed events of all time  </p><br>

						<h4>Ultimate Frisbee </h4>
						<p> One of my other hobbies is Frisbee Ultimate. This sport is similar to American football in terms of pitch layout and rules. Instead, Frisbee Ultimate is a non-contact sport. The aim is to get the Frisbee in the opponents dead-zone to score a point, when the Frisbee is in your possession you are not allowed to move and must pass it to your teammates before the opponent counts to 10, this is called a stall out. I currently play Frisbee with the DCU Ultimate Society, it is very fun and I meet new people constantly.</p> <br>

						 <h4> The Gym </h4>
						 <p> I have been in the gym for over a year now and I really got hooked from the start. The thing I enjoy most is seeing the progress you make over the time you spend in the gym, being able to see how one week you can lift x amount and then in a couple of weeks you can lift 2x amount really helps with your overall satisfaction and pride you get. Going to the gym can also help you unload after a hard day. Being able to give your all and seeing results is a beautiful feeling. Taking care of your body is very important especially within a department which involves a lot of sedentary lifestyle. </p>
